Scheme: Different variations of your app that you can run in simulator
    Ex: iPhone vs Watch, or different iPhone screen sizes

Storyboards: What building of the UI.
    LaunchScreen storyboard: what you see when you launch
    Main: The rest of the app.
    Canvas: where your GUI goes
    Scenes: Views and the code to manipulate them.
        Each scene references some viewcontroller class (ex: ViewController.swift)
        Look in the identity inspector to see which one.

View Controller Scene: How your view is controlled. Look for red error messages.

Inspectors: Inspect different elements of your code or storyboard objects
    File
    Quick help
    identity: info about the id of object, what class it's inheriting from or refferencing.
    Attributes: different attributes of the object you can change. (size font color for ex.)

    Scaling rules: use the buttons on the bottem right.
        Allign: set rules for when the screen size or orientation swithces.
        Add contraints: Set auto layout contraint, based on other objects.


### Tutorial WWDC Xcode 2016 ###
Make button that says hello in a label:
    Go to object library in the bottom right of xcode: you can add these to your scene
        Place button at center of scene, name it: "Say Hello"
        Add Label above button and allign it horizontally.
    Make the button both horizontally and vertically alligned.
        Error lable: y pos: contrain it or pin it to be above the button.
        Check if it worked by rotating in simulator.
    Add code to say hello when clicking the button
        edit the file that your view controller is refferencing (ViewController.swift)
