import SwiftUI

// This is the ViewModel. It's an implementation of the model for our view, the translation
// You use Emoji's in our View for the Cards, so the model is inited with emojis or String.
// Import SwiftUI because it's Foundation + UI stuff to bind the view and model

// Class because it's a ViewModel, a portal onto the Model from the View's perspective
// Many views can use the ViewModel and thus want to share an instance of it.
// Classes are in the heap, and passed by refference: many Views can look at it when
// they want to.
// !!!!!This class is built for a specific implementation of the model: MemoryGame<String>
// !!!!!So the MemoryGame.Card.content is a Sring

// ObservableObject needs to be a class. Gains an objectWillChange var behind the scenes
// This way, the View know that the data in the model can update via this ViewModel.
// So it starts checking for changes. This var has a method 'send'. When it's called,
// The viewmodel tells the world that SOMETHING WILL CHANGE, pay attention.
// Views know it's time to check and update

class EmojiMemoryGame: ObservableObject {
    
    
    // MARK: - Properties.
    // The model of the MemoryGame. It's private Prevents one view from changing the model
    // when you don't want it.
    // @Published makes it objectWillChange.send() is called every time the models changes
    // This way, the ViewModel is telling al the views that are looking at it that changes
    // Are made and redraws are needed. The view needs code to redraw on publish.
    @Published private var game: MemoryGame<String> = EmojiMemoryGame.createMemoryGame()
    
    // The cards of the model. Used to let views see the model. You implement it this way
    // so the model can have functionality to present the data in an optiomal way for the View
    // Defined for MemoryGame with String as the MemoryGame.Card.content
    var cards: Array<MemoryGame<String>.Card> {
        return game.cards.shuffled()

    // Notice the inline function notation: closure notation
    // Returns a MemoryGame with <String> and uses the init arguments to make it.
    static func createMemoryGame() -> MemoryGame<String> {
        // So take a array of emojies, and for the lenght of the array, return a string with than emoji
        // the model uses that emoji as content, since the game property sets it the String.
        // The model loops until all the emojis are use because it's equal to numbberOfPairsOfCards.
        // The model puts every index up until the numberOfPairsofCards in the closure that is passed
        // So 0 -> emojis[0], the first emoji. then 1 -> emojis[1] etc. 
        let emojis: Array<String> = ["ðŸŽƒ", "ðŸ‘»", "ðŸ•·"]

    // intents methods. These define certain ways certain views can change the model.
