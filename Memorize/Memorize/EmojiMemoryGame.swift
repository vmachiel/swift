// This is the ViewModel. It's an implementation of the model for our view, the translation
// You use Emoji's in our View for the Cards, so the model is inited with emojis or String.
// Import SwiftUI because it's Foundation + UI stuff to bind the view and model

// Class because it's a ViewModel, a portal onto the Model from the View's perspective
// Many views can use the ViewModel and thus want to share an instance of it.
// Classes are in the heap, and passed by refference: many Views can look at it when
// they want to.
// !!!!!This class is built for a specific implementation of the model: MemoryGame<String>
// !!!!!So the MemoryGame.Card.content is a Sring
