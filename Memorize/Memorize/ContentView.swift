    // The some is to indicate it needs to be some kind of view.
    // It can be a combination of all sorts of Views, as long as it's a View. (Lego analogy).
    // Views aren't stored but computed: everytime body is request its contents
    // get executed and returned. When type of view it is, depends on execution
    var body: some View {
        // Puts contents (VIEWS!) over each other and alligns them.
        // stroke doesn't do the default fill, but just the edge.
