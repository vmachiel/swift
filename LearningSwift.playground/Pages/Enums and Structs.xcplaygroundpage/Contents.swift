// enums are a sort of blueprint. Classes and structs represent data, while
// enums are often used to limit the value of a variable to a set number of options
// You don't have to provide a value for each case: cases are be their own value!!!
// unless you assign something to them.
// Take this example
enum CardSuit {
    case clubs
    case diamonds
    case spades
    case hearts
}
// use them like this:
var testDeck: CardSuit
testDeck = .diamonds
print(testDeck)
// or
var testDeck2: CardSuit
testDeck2 = CardSuit.spades
print(testDeck2)
// or
var testDeck3 = CardSuit.clubs
print(testDeck3)
// These have NO rawValue, and are their own values

// You can also state that each case DOES get a raw value.
// And you can make the compiler assign them implicitely:
enum Planet: Int {
    case mercury = 1, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune  // venus = 2 etc
}
// You can define them on one line
enum WeekDay {
    case monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday
}



// You use enum values mainly with the switch statement.
var today = WeekDay.tuesday
switch today {
case .monday, .tuesday, .thursday:
    print("you have class")
case .wednesday:
    print("study day!")
default:
    print("Weekend!")
}
// you can define functions too!
enum Rank: Int {
    // the enum has been typed as an Int, so it'll autocomplete the rawValues
    // It normally starts and 0, but you can define the first case as something else
    // and it'll increment from there
    case ace = 1
    case two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
    case jack, queen, king
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .ace:  // use the .ace notation because the self is known to be Rank
            return "ace"
        case .jack:
            return "jack"
        case .queen:
            return "queen"
        case .king:
            return "king"
        default:
            return String(self.rawValue)
        }
    }
}
let ace = Rank.ace
ace.rawValue
ace.simpleDescription()
let five = Rank.five
five.rawValue
five.simpleDescription()
let queen = Rank.queen
queen.rawValue
queen.simpleDescription()
// And one more example with rawValues:
enum State: Int {
    case ready = 0
    case set
    case go
}
var raceState = State.ready
raceState.rawValue // 0
var nextRaceState = State(rawValue: raceState.rawValue + 1)
nextRaceState?.rawValue  // You need the ? in case there is no rawValue match. Since you 
// made nextRaceState from a rawValue operation. 
// Here's one more example with the Rank enum
if let convertedRank = Rank(rawValue: 3) {
    let threeDescription = convertedRank.simpleDescription()
}
// Code for the Suit to be used in the struct later:
enum Suit {
    case spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        switch self {
        case .spades:
            return "spades"
        case .hearts:
            return "hearts"
        case .diamonds:
            return "diamonds"
        case .clubs:
            return "clubs"
        }
    }
}

// You can assign value or values if you want. In the case of Cheque, you need to supply an
// int for example.
enum PaymentMethod {
    case cash // No extra data needed, cash is its own value
    case cheque(Int) // Cheque #. own value, must be Int
    case card(cardType: String, cardNumber: Int) // 2 pieces of extra data.
}
let payExample1 = PaymentMethod.cash
let payExample2 = PaymentMethod.cheque(52)
let payExample3 = PaymentMethod.card(cardType: "Visa", cardNumber: 1234567890)

// you can use swith statements to take different types of actions. Swith pay Example to
// 1, 2 and 3 see what happens.
switch payExample3 {
case .cash:
    print("Client paid in cash")
case let .cheque(ammountPaid):  // use let to assign the Int variable to ammountPaid
    print("Client paid with a cheque of \(ammountPaid)")
case let .card(cardType, cardNumber): // use let to assign the cardType can cardNumber
    // to the same named parameters.
    print("The client paid with a \(cardType), card with number: \(cardNumber)")
}

// One more thing: you can use the value of a enum case in logic by using the where keyword
// You assign the value of speed with let
enum WeatherType {
    case sun
    case cloud
    case rain
    case wind(speed: Int)
    case snow
}
// Remember: switch go in order: so place the special .speed case before the general one!
func getHaterStatus(weather: WeatherType) -> String? {
    switch weather {
    case .sun:
        return nil
    case .wind(let speed) where speed < 10:
        return "Meh"
    case .wind, .cloud:
        return "dislike"
    case .rain, .snow:
        return "hate"
    }
}
print(getHaterStatus(weather: WeatherType.wind(speed: 5))!)

// or something like
if let haterStatus = getHaterStatus(weather: .wind(speed: 15)) {
    print("They are kinda like: \(haterStatus)")
} else {
    print("They ain't hating!")
}




// Structs! Basic struct syntax: no need for init like classes

struct Card {
    var rank: Rank  // These are you self made enums!
    var suit: Suit
    func simpleDescription() -> String {
        return "The \(rank.simpleDescription()) of \(suit.simpleDescription())"
    }
}
let theAceOfSpace = Card(rank: .ace, suit: .spades)
let cardDescription = theAceOfSpace.simpleDescription()

/* Classes vs structs
Classes and structures in Swift have many things in common. Both can:

Define properties to store values
Define methods to provide functionality
Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax
Define initializers to set up their initial state
Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation
Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind
For more information, see Properties, Methods, Subscripts, Initialization, Extensions, and Protocols.

Classes have additional capabilities that structures do not:

Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.
Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.
Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned.
Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.

Structers are always passed around when copied, classed passed by reference!!!!

// More struct examples, if a stuct properties have default values, initializing with
// () is possible:
struct Rectangle {
    var height: Int
    var width: Int
}
var rectangle = Rectangle(height: 10, width: 12)

struct Rectangle2 {
    var height = 10
    var width = 12
}
var rectangle2 = Rectangle2()
// Stucts can have competed properties, which are caculatedo on the fly when you need 
// them, and can depend on other properties
struct Rectangle3 {
    var height: Int
    var width: Int
    var area: Int {
        return width * height
    }
}
var rectangle3 = Rectangle3(height: 3, width: 5)
print("The area of this rectangle is \(rectangle3.area)")

// You can also have generic structs which elements whose type is specified later
// Usefull for tableview
struct NamedArray<Element> {
    var name: String
    var items: [Element]
}
// You don't have to write the type of Element if you don't want.
let boardGames = NamedArray<String>(name: "Board Games", items: ["Backgammon, Chess"])
let primes = NamedArray(name: "Prime Numbers", items: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11])



// Structures can also have property getters, setters and observers just like classes. 
// You define them inside the variable {} block.
// willSet is a special method run before a property is set to a new value and didSet is run
// after a property has been set to a new value.
// In willSet, swift uses newValue to refer to the new value
// in didSet,  swift uses oldValue to refer to the old value.



struct Person {
    var age: Int
    var clothes: String {
        willSet {
            updateUI(msg: "I'm changing from \(clothes) to \(newValue)")
        }
        didSet {
            updateUI(msg: "I've changed from \(oldValue) to \(clothes)")
        }
    }
    var ageInDogYears: Int {
        get {
            return age * 7
        }
        set {
            print("Calculating dog year...")  // will only run when value is changed.
        }
    }
}

func updateUI(msg: String) {
    print(msg)
}

var vmachiel = Person(age: 29, clothes: "Suit")
vmachiel.clothes = "T-Shirt"
vmachiel.ageInDogYears



/* Structure instances are always passed by value, and class instances are always passed by
reference. This means that they are suited to different kinds of tasks. As you consider the
data constructs and functionality that you need for a project, decide whether each data
construct should be defined as a class or as a structure.

As a general guideline, consider creating a structure when one or more of these conditions apply:

The structureâ€™s primary purpose is to encapsulate a few relatively simple data values.
It is reasonable to expect that the encapsulated values will be copied rather than
referenced when you assign or pass around an instance of that structure.
Any properties stored by the structure are themselves value types, which would also be
expected to be copied rather than referenced.
The structure does not need to inherit properties or behavior from another existing type.
Examples of good candidates for structures include:

The size of a geometric shape, perhaps encapsulating a width property and a height
property, both of type Double.
A way to refer to ranges within a series, perhaps encapsulating a start property and
a length property, both of type Int.
A point in a 3D coordinate system, perhaps encapsulating x, y and z properties, each
of type Double.
In all other cases, define a class, and create instances of that class to be managed
and passed by reference. In practice, this means that most custom data constructs
should be classes, not structures.
