// So if one gets set, the willSet method takes that
// new value and sets it to the other, so they're te same!!!!

// Another example to better show explicitly stating names newVal instead of newValue

    }
}

// optional values work ond self defined classes as well:
let optionalSquare: Square? = Square(sideLength: 4.4, name: "optional square")
let sidelength = optionalSquare?.sideLength // does it exist? than assign.


// Classes are reference types, so when you say let instance = Class() you can still
// change properties even though it's let. instance is only a pointer to the class data.
// More than one reference can point to the same data. Check if they do like so:
class TestClass2 {
    
    var doubleTheAmmount: Int
    
    init(inputAmmount: Int) {
        self.doubleTheAmmount = inputAmmount * 2
    }
}
let doubleOfTwenty = TestClass2(inputAmmount: 20)
let anotherReference = doubleOfTwenty
anotherReference.doubleTheAmmount = 80
doubleOfTwenty.doubleTheAmmount

// Check it with:
if doubleOfTwenty === anotherReference {
    print("They point to the same stuff!")
}






/* Classes vs structs
Classes and structures in Swift have many things in common. Both can:

Define properties to store values
Define methods to provide functionality
Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax
Define initializers to set up their initial state
Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation
Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind
For more information, see Properties, Methods, Subscripts, Initialization, Extensions, and Protocols.

Classes have additional capabilities that structures do not:

Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.
Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.
Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned.
Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.

Structers are always passed around when copied, classed passed by reference!!!!
*/




/* Structure instances are always passed by value, and class instances are always passed by
 reference. This means that they are suited to different kinds of tasks.
 As you consider the data constructs and functionality that you need for a project,
 decide whether each data construct should be defined as a class or as a structure.
 
 As a general guideline, consider creating a structure when one or more of these conditions apply:
 
 - The structureâ€™s primary purpose is to encapsulate a few relatively simple data values.
 - It is reasonable to expect that the encapsulated values will be copied rather than
 referenced when you assign or pass around an instance of that structure.
 - Any properties stored by the structure are themselves value types, which would also be
 expected to be copied rather than referenced.
 - The structure does not need to inherit properties or behavior from another existing
 type.
 
 Examples of good candidates for structures include:
 - The size of a geometric shape, perhaps encapsulating a width property and a height
 property, both of type Double.
 - A way to refer to ranges within a series, perhaps encapsulating a start property and
 a length property, both of type Int.
 - A point in a 3D coordinate system, perhaps encapsulating x, y and z properties, each
 of type Double.
 - In all other cases, define a class, and create instances of that class to be managed
 and passed by reference. In practice, this means that most custom data constructs
 should be classes, not structures.
